# ReacHGNN
A novel molecular graph heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) for capturing local intermolecular reactivity.

## Overview
This repository includes the codes and results for our paper:
***Capturing inter-molecular reactivity using heterogeneous graph neural network***

ReacHGNN aims to provide a general framework for solving inter-molecular reaction performance prediction tasks, including the construction method of reaction heterogeneous graph (***RHG***) representation and the corresponding neural network architecture (***ReacHGNN***). It supports the prediction of different types of reactivity indicators such as reaction yield, transition state energy barrier, enantioselectivity and reaction rate constant which are included in this repo.
